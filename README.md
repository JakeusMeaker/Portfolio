# My Portfolio

Here are some of the games I have worked on which I am most proud of.

1. WizBang: WizBang is my current project for university. This is our current working build. We have focused heavily on gameply so the full game loop is not finished. 
  However, I wished to shop my work on the character select screen as it is getting close to where I want it.
  The game requires Xbox controllers and is currently for 1 - 4 players. 
  Controls are: 
    Menu: Left stick to choose character
          A to select
          B to cancel selection
          Start/Menu button once all players have selected characters to begin
   
    Gameplay: Left stick to move
              Right stick to aim arm
              Left bumper to jump
              Left trigger to dash (dashes in direction of left stick)
              Right bumper to dropkick (hold and move Right stick to aim)
              Right trigger to fire spell (hold for bigger spell, aim with Right stick)
  The game then will run infinitely and requires alt+f4 to close. This will be resolved within the next couple sprints.
  
2. A Day at the Paw-k: This game was made by me and 2 other people for the Global Game Jam 2020/ It is a point and click adventure where you guide a pup around and helping other people. This game was made in under 48 hours
